# Adding Contacts to a Page

## Overview

Contact records are stored in OHA Connect to ensure a single source of truth for that record and to leverage reporting features of Connect. The website calls the OHA Connect API to get the contact information, so the data is always synced with whatever value is stored in Connect. While all pages allow you to associate contacts to that page, only some templates call for those contacts to be displayed on the page. Consult the [Template Doumentation](/templates/) to see whether or not the page you're editing will display contacts.

## Navigate to the Page Form

In order to add a contact, you must first navigate to the page you'd like to edit, and select the "Form" tab at the top of the edit panel.
